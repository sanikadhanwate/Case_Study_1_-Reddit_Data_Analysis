    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume you are new to the data science field, and you want to find out what real practitioners and soon-to-be data scientists are concerned about. One place where you may find such information is X (formerly known as Twitter). However, X users often use their real identities and may have reservations about sharing all their opinions publicly. Another place where such information maybe found is the datascience subreddit on Reddit.com (https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/). Users are assumed to be anonymous and they are more likely to share their opinions without reservations. To find out common concerns among the datascience subreddit users, it might be a good idea to collect the top 100 posts in the subreddit in the year 2025. You might also collect the top 3 comments of each of those posts. In this case study, we will do exactly that. Specific details can be found in the next few cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "The collected dataset can be used for many different projects. However, we are only going to focus on the \"data gathering\" part. We will also do some cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: \n",
    "\n",
    "This case study contributes 10% to your overall grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, this is not a group project. But if you think you will benefit from working with a partner, you are welcome to find a partner. In that case, please send an email to the TA and the professor by **September 2, 2025**. Please note that if you choose to work with a partner, it will not impact your score, but you must send the email by September 2. Only one email is enough. Please make sure to CC your partner in the email."

    "**Description**:\n",
    "Once you have the mechanism in place to retrieve data from Reddit, you next step is to determine which parts of the data is necessary. For this case study, collect only the top posts from the year 2025. Also consider if the score of each post was above 50 or not. If the score was below 50, it might not have been an important post. Do not consider those posts. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may also observe that sometimes posts with memes or jokes get a lot of 'upvotes,' and because of that they may  have high scores, but they may not be useful for this case study. To address this problem, you will simply get rid of any post that has fewer than 5 words in the title. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will also notice that praw returns time as an integer. It is inconvenient for us to read time like that. You may want to convert the integer time to human readable time. You do not need to mention hours, minutes, or seconds. Just year, month and date is enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grading Criteria:**\n",
    "* posts are only from the year 2025: 10 points\n",
    "* the integer time format converted into year-month-day: 20 points\n",
    "* only posts with scores more than 50 were considered: 10 points\n",
    "* only post titles with more than 5 words were kept: 15 points\n",
    "* minimum 100 posts were collected: 5 points\n",
    "* post title, body of the post (if present), and three comments collected for each post: 5 points\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: All six grading criteria can be satified by writing one line or many lines of code. It does not matter. As long as your code satisfies the six criteria (in one line or many lines), you will get full points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note: In case the API does not allow you to collect 100 posts, you can collect 80 or 90 etc. In that case, please copy and paste the error message in a new cell below."
